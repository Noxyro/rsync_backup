# rsync_backup
Wrapper script for incremental rsync backups

This script helps in creating incremental backups with the linux command-line tool rsync, by providing some useful input options that prevent most of the common mistakes while entering parameters for rsync.

WARNING: this is highly WIP and in no way meant for productive use!
In the current state this provides no more, than a personal error correction utility.
